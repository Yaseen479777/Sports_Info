        <p class = "txt"><p>Cricket is a game played between two teams, generally of 11 members each. In essence, it is single combat, in which an individual batsman does battle against an individual bowler, who has helpers known as fielders. The bowler propels the ball with a straight arm from one end of the 22-yard pitch in an attempt to dismiss the batsman by hitting a target known as the wicket at the other end, or by causing the batsman to hit the ball into the air into a fielder's grasp, or by inducing one of a number of other indiscretions. The batsman attempts to defend the wicket with the bat and to score runs - the currency of the game - by striking the ball to the field boundary, or far enough from the fielders to allow the batsman to run to the other end of the pitch before the ball can be returned.</p><p> At least two bowlers must take turns, from alternating ends; also, there are always two batsmen on the field, each to take a turn as required. When all but one of the batting team have been dismissed - or after an agreed period - the teams' roles are reversed. After all the players required to bat on both sides have done so either once or twice (which can take from a few hours to five days) the total number of runs accumulated determines the winner. But sometimes there isn't one. </p><p>Today, it is a popular sport in England, Australia, the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh), South Africa, New Zealand, the West Indies and several other countries such as Afghanistan, Ireland, Kenya, Scotland, the Netherlands and Zimbabwe.</p></p>

        <p><p>The origin of cricket is unknown. Most probably, its name was derived from the Old English cryce, which means “stick,” and, in its rude form, resembled the 13th century game known as club-ball.

Cricket evolved in England in the 18th century, mainly because of the interest of great landowners who tried their skills on a field of play with their tenants and the local peasantry.

Records show that teams from Kent and London played each other in 1719, and that Kent and Sussex met in 1728.

The earliest written laws (rules) date back to 1744. The Hambledon Club in Hampshire was the focal point of cricket from 1768 to about 1788.</p><p>

It attracted the chief patrons and best cricketers in the land and was the place where cricket took a great step forward from the rather rustic pastime that it was to the game it is today.

In 1787, Thomas Lord, a Yorkshireman, opened a cricket ground in London, and in that year the Marylebone Cricket Club was formed.

Today the present Lord’s at St. John’s Wood is the most famous cricket venue in the world and the M. C. C. is the authoritative source of all cricket legislation.

As early as 1859 an All-England team toured Canada and the United States, and in 1861 a team toured Australia. Australia won the first recorded international match in Melbourne in 1877, defeating England by 45 runs. 5 years later, in 1882 Australia won again in London.</p><p>

The Sporting Times in a mock obituary said “In affectionate remembrance of English cricket. … The body will be cremated, and the Ashes taken to Australia.”

Since then matches between England and Australia, called The Ashes, have been the highlight of cricket competition. Other participants in Test matches include South Africa, the West Indies, New Zealand, India, and Pakistan. </p><p>The ruling body for the Test matches is the International Cricket Conference, founded in 1909 as the Imperial Cricket Conference.</p>

      <p>One team will bat first and one team will field first. The batting team will try and score as many runs as possible in the allotted time whilst the bowling team will try and contain them by fielding the ball. The teams then swap and the second team batting will try and outscore the runs their opponents scored first. If they fail they lose, if they succeed they win.</p>
      <p><b>Steps</b></p>
<p>◘	Each team is made up of 11 players.<br>
◘	The bowler must bowl 6 legal deliveries to constitute an over.<br>
◘	A game must have two umpires stood at either end of the wicket. The umpires then must count the number of balls in the over, make decisions on whether the batsmen is out after an appeal and also check that the bowler has bowled a legal delivery.<br>
◘	A batsmen can be given out by either being bowled ( the ball hitting their stumps), caught (fielder catches the ball without it bouncing), Leg Before Wicket (the ball hits the batsmen’s pads impeding its line into the stumps), stumped (the wicket keeper strikes the stumps with their gloves whilst the batsmen is outside of their crease with ball in hand), hit wicket (the batsmen hits their own wicket), Handled ball ( the batsmen handles the cricket ball on purpose), timed out (the player fails to reach the crease within 30 seconds of the previous batsmen leaving the field), hit ball twice (batsmen hits the cricket ball twice with their bat) and obstruction ( the batsmen purposely prevents the fielder from getting the ball).<br><p>◘The fielding team must have one designated wicket keeper who is the only person allow to wear pads and gloves on the field. The wicket keeper stands behind the opposite end to the bowler to catch the ball.</p>

       <p>
       <p>I would like to mention "Aggressive batting approach" adopted by Srilankan team in Australian series just before 1996 world cup where middle order batsmen Romesh Kaluwitharana (WK) and Sanath Jayasuriya were promoted to open the innings. This was a kind of all-out attack approach in the first 15 overs where fielding restriction was present.</p>

<p><b>Steps</b></p>

<p>1. The bowling side would be forced to extend the spell of the specialist bowler, allowing the down ordered specialist batsmen to face more deliveries against the fifth and sixth bowlers at the back end of the innings. </p>

<p>2. With high strike rate by the openers , Bowl get softened very early and becomes more easier to bat for the middle order batsmen.</p>
<p>3.	Get the psychological advantage by getting quick runs at the initial stage of the game.
 </p>

<p>4. It is very important that the bowlers do the basics and bowl legitimate deliveries. As the last 4 overs per innings result in extra runs and an extra ball for illegitimate deliveries, the captain would want to keep his best bowlers for last, obviously this depends on the match situation. </p>

<p>5.Many players seem to panic when they lose a wicket, and try to recover the lost runs by trying to hit the back net off the very next ball. A much more successful strategy is to work even harder at not losing another wicket, and continuing to strive for the 1 or 2 runs per ball.</p>

<p>The Facts of cricket are as Followed.</p>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>

       <p>◘It is thought that cricket may have its origins with shepherds in England who devised the game as a way of passing the time while guarding their sheep.</p>

·         <p>◘There have been many cricketers who were believed to be the greatest bowler in history, however the English magazine “The Wisden Cricketer” awards the title to Murali Muralitharan from Sri Lanka.</p>

·         <p>◘History’s longest cricket match was played in 1939 between South Africa and England. The single match lasted for an epic 14 days and even after two weeks the game still wasn’t over with England needing 42 more runs if they were to win. However as their ship back home was due to leave the next day eventually the match was declared to be a draw.</p>

·      <p> ◘The first game of cricket ever recorded took place in 1646. The game proved to be so popular that eventually fines had to be given to those who missed church in order to play.</p></p>
