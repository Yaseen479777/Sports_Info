Early evidence of soccer being played as a sport finds occurrence in China during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BC. In China, it was during the Han dynasty that people dribbled leather balls by kicking it into a small net. Recorded facts also support the fact that Romans and Greeks used to play ball for fun and frolic. Some facts point to Kyoto in Japan where kicking of ball was a popular sport.</p>
      <p>It is said that early growth of the modern soccer started in England. Some amusing facts even mention that the first ball used was the head of some Danish brigand. It is said that during medieval times, the old form of soccer used to allow many ill practices like kicking, punching, biting and gouging. The main aim was to carry the ball to a target spot. People grew so fond of the game that they would throng the field all day long.Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association).</p>
      <p>The most prestigious international football competition is the FIFA World Cup, held every four years. This event, the most widely viewed in the world, boasts an audience twice that of the Summer Olympic Games.The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures.</p>

        <p>Games revolving around the kicking of a ball have been played in many countries throughout history.Various forms of football were played in medieval Europe, though rules varied greatly by both period and location.</p>

<p>The modern rules of football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played at the public schools of England.</p>
<p>During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Other English rugby football clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, or subsequently left the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.
The Board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football Association of Wales, and the Irish Football Association. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.  The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the International Football Association Board in 1913. Today, football is played at a professional level all over the world.</p>
<p>The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures for over 3000 years ago. 

The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name Cuju.Recorded facts also support the fact that Romans and Greeks used to play ball for fun and frolic.</p>

      <p>There are seventeen Rules in the official Rules of the Game. The same Rules are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and the physically challenged are permitted. The Rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. In addition to the seventeen Rules, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football. The Rules of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board, not FIFA itself.[ The most complex of the Rules is offside. The offside law limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line.The Rules of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association.</p>
      <p><b>Steps</b></p>
<p>◘	Two teams of eleven try to guide a soccer ball into goal cages at opposite ends of the field, 	using different parts of their body.<br>
◘	Only the goalkeeper may use his/her hands.<br>
◘	When a penalty is committed inside the eighteen-yard-line, the opposite team is granted a penalty kick.<br>
◘	A direct kick is when a team gets a penalty shot on goal and no other player has to touch it before a goal may be scored<br>
◘	An indirect kick is the same as a direct kick, but another player must touch the ball before a goal may be scored.<br>

◘	Shoulder - to- shoulder contact is allowed.</p>

       <p>While the premise of football seems simple--to kick the ball into the opposing team's goal--the strategies are endless. Only by understanding the complexities of the game can you truly appreciate a good match. Here's how to enhance your understanding of this beautiful game.</p>

<p><b>Steps</b></p>

<p>1.Pay attention to the diagonal runs behind the defense. A center forward making an angled run just behind another defender, say a 10 yard sprint, at just the right moment, could be getting ready to receive the ball. </p>

<p>2. Look for how a third man running opens up the game. A midfielder and forward might exchange a few passes on the side and then a defender (a third player) will break towards the goal from behind to receive the ball – almost out of nowhere.</p>
<p>3.	Watch how quick give-and-goes, both static and moving, open up the defense. A player can play a wall-pass (a give and go) just to get more time on the ball if he’s being closed down (static), or can play the ball and then sprint into the space to receive the ball. </p>

<p>4. Discover how switching the field of play gives players more time and space. Two or three passes on one side of the field and suddenly there’s no space, the defense has closed the offensive team down. </p>

<p>5. Learn how counter attacks can lead to goal scoring opportunities. A team may just hunker down and pack their players into their goal box and leave one player up high, waiting to break down the field when they win possession.</p>
