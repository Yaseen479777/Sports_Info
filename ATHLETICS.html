        <p class = "txt"><p>Athletics is a collection of sporting events that involve competitive running, jumping, throwing, and walking. The most common types of athletics competitions are track and field, road running, cross country running, and race walking.

.The results of racing events are decided by finishing position (or time, where measured), while the jumps and throws are won by the athlete that achieves the highest or furthest measurement from a series of attempts. The simplicity of the competitions, and the lack of a need for expensive equipment, makes athletics one of the most commonly competed sports in the world. Athletics is mostly an individual sport, with the exception of relay races and competitions which combine athletes' performances for a team score, such as cross country.</p>
<p>
Organized athletics are traced back to the Ancient Olympic Games from 776 BC. The rules and format of the modern events in athletics were defined in Western Europe and North America in the 19th and early 20th century, and were then spread to other parts of the world. Most modern top level meetings are conducted by the International Association of Athletics Federations and its member federations.</p><p>

The athletics meeting forms the backbone of the Summer Olympics. The foremost international athletics meeting is the IAAF World Championships in Athletics, which incorporates track and field, marathon running and race walking. Other top level competitions in athletics include the IAAF World Cross Country Championships and the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. Athletes with a physical disability compete at the Summer Paralympics and the World Para Athletics Championships</p></p>

        <p><p>Athletic contests in running, walking, jumping and throwing are among the oldest of all sports and their roots are prehistoric. Athletics events were depicted in the Ancient Egyptian tombs in Saqqara, with illustrations of running at the Heb Sed festival and high jumping appearing in tombs from as early as of 2250 BC. The Tailteann Games were an ancient Celtic festival in Ireland, founded circa 1800 BC, and the thirty-day meeting included running and stone-throwing among its sporting events.The original and only event at the first Olympics in 776 BC was a stadium-length running event known as the stadion. This later expanded to include throwing and jumping events within the ancient pentathlon. Athletics competitions also took place at other Panhellenic Games, which were founded later around 500 BC.</p><p>


The Cotswold Olimpick Games, a sports festival which emerged in 17th century England, featured athletics in the form of sledgehammer throwing contests. Annually, from 1796 to 1798, L'Olympiade de la RÃ©publique was held in revolutionary France, and is an early forerunner to the modern summer Olympic Games. The premier event of this competition was a running event, but various ancient Greek disciplines were also on display. The 1796 Olympiade marked the introduction of the metric system into the sport.
</p><p>
Athletics competitions were held about 1812 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and in 1840 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire at the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt. The Royal Military Academy at Woolwich held an organised competition in 1849, and a regular series of closed meetings open only to undergraduates, was held by Exeter College, Oxford from 1850. The annual Wenlock Olympian Games, first held in 1850 in Wenlock, England, incorporated athletics events into its sports programme.</p><p>

The first modern-style indoor athletics meetings were recorded shortly after in the 1860s, including a meet at Ashburnham Hall in London which featured four running events and a triple jump competition.</p></p>

The most recent complete set of rules is the 2009 rules that relate only to competitions in 2009. Key rules of track events are those regarding starting, running and finishing.</p>
      <p><b>Steps</b></p>
<p>â	The start of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. In all races that are not run in lanes the start line must be curved, so that all the athletes start the same distance from the finish. Starting blocks may be used for all races up to and including 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 x 200 m and 4 x 400 m) and may not be used for any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.<br>
â	In all races run in lanes, each athlete must keep within his allocated lane from start to finish. This also applies to any portion of a race run in lanes. If an athlete leaves the track or steps on the line demarking the track, he/she should be disqualified. Also, any athlete who jostles or obstructs another athlete, in a way that impedes his progress, should be disqualified from that event. However, if an athlete is pushed or forced by another person to run outside his lane, and if no material advantage is gained, the athlete should not be disqualified.<br>
â	The finish of a race is marked by a white line 5 cm wide. The athletes must be placed in the order in which any part of their torso ( as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line.<br>

       <p>In athletics, 2000â2001 was a year to celebrate outstanding seasons for many of the University's twenty-four sports teams. It was also a time to contemplate the future of these programs and to begin crafting a long-range strategy for sustaining a winning tradition.

Programs that posted exceptional records include women's rowing and the men's swimming and diving team, both Atlantic Coast Conference champions. The men's basketball team finished with a 20-9 record and its first appearance in the NCAA tournament since 1997. The football team earned a postseason trip to the O'ahu Bowl. </p>

<p><b>Steps</b></p>

<p>1.Among individual student-athletes who deserve to be singled out for their accomplishments are Conor Gill, Mark Koontz, and Lauri Kenis in lacrosse; Huntley Montgomery in tennis; Naccole Guinn, Inge Jorgensen, Brian Kollar, and John Welch in track and field; Marlies Smulders in women's rowing; and Luke Wagner, Gary Marshall, and Mirjana Bosevska in swimming and diving. </p>

<p>2. All were first-team All-America selections in 2000â2001. Cara Lane, also a first-team All-American, was the NCAA champion in the 1650-yard freestyle and was named ACC Women's Swimmer of the Year. Brian Vahaly finished a college career unmatched in Virginia tennis history.</p>
<p>3.	Our coaches also won honors. Randy Bungard, head track and field coach, was selected ACC Men's Track and Field Coach of the Year and was named the Southeast Regional Coach of the Year by the United States Track and Field Coaches Association. Head swimming coach Mark Bernardino was named ACC Men's Swimming Coach of the Year and was head coach of the United States men's swimming team at the 2001 World University Games.  </p>

<p>Following are the some facts of Athletics.</p>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>

       <p>âPara Athletics consists of a wide range of competitions and events carried out on either the track or in the field.<br>
âTrack events can be divided into three main categories: events that require running on a track over a defined distance, running events with obstacles placed on the track, and relay events.<br>
âSprint events are largely based upon the athleteâs ability to accelerate to his or her maximum speed in the quickest time possible, and are seen as the glamour events of athletics.<br>
âField events in athletics take place on a large field, as opposed to the running track. They can be classified as jumping and throwing categories.<br>
âAt the recent 54th National Schools Track and Field Championships, V S Mohamed Jawhardeen of Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary sprang into prominence when he took home both the A Division 100 metres and 200m gold medals.<br>
âEntrepreneur, athlete, student. Calvin is all of the above. How many of you know that not only is he a national athlete, but also, an entrepreneur and a student too?<br>
