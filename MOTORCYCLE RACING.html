        <p class = "txt"><p>Motorcycle racing, the recreational and competitive use of motorcycles, a sport practiced by both professionals and amateurs on roads, tracks, closed circuits, and natural terrain.</p><p>

The development of motorcycling largely paralleled and often coincided with the development of automobile sports. There was a class for motorcycles in many of the old town-to-town automobile road races, the Paris-Vienna race, for example. The de Dion tricycle dominated the sport in 1897, but two-wheelers like the Werner soon set the stage for an entirely different form of racing. In 1904 the Fédération Internationale du Motocyclisme (renamed the Fédération Internationale Motocycliste [FIM] in 1949) created the international cup, uniting five nations: Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, and Britain. The first international cup race took place in 1905 at Dourdan, France. The race for the Tourist Trophy (TT) became the most famous of all European motorcycle races, however. </p><p>
Motorcycle racing in North America began in 1903 with the formation of the Federation of American Motorcyclists in New York City. By 1924 this society evolved into the still-active American Motorcycle Association. Since 1937 the Daytona 200-mile (320-kilometre) race has been the leading U.S. race. It is held on the same road circuit used for the 24-hour Daytona auto race. Grand Prix racing (in the sense of being a major event in the country in which it is held) for motorcycles started in the United States soon after auto racing resumed after the end of World War I. </p></p>

        <p>Arguably, the first motorcycle was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt (since 1905 a city district of Stuttgart) in 1885. The first petroleum-powered vehicle was essentially a motorised bicycle, although the inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). However, if a two-wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle, then the first one may have been American. One such machine was demonstrated at fairs and circuses in the eastern U.S. in 1867, built by Sylvester Howard Roper of Roxbury, Massachusetts.</p><p>

A pre-war Polish Sokół 1000
In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first motorcycle available for purchase.In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased.</p><p>
Until the First World War, the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was Indian, producing over 20,000 bikes per year.By 1920, this honour went to Harley-Davidson, with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries. By the late 1920s or early 1930s, DKW took over as the largest manufacturer.
After the Second World War, the BSA Group became the largest producer of motorcycles in the world, producing up to 75,000 bikes per year in the 1950s.[citation needed] The German company NSU held the position of largest manufacturer from 1955 until the 1970s.</p><p>


From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of East German Walter Kaaden's engine work in the 1950s.</p></p>

      <p>Motorcycle racing (also known as Moto racing and Bike racing) is a motorcycle sport involving racing motorcycles. The FIM is the international sanctioning body for motorcycle racing and most nations have their own governing bodies. Other breakaway/independent bodies exist on both a national and an international level.Following are the some rules of Motorcycle Racing.  </p>
      <p><b>Steps</b></p>
<p>◘The GCRs contain the rules and guidelines for participating in and conducting Motorcycle Sport, and are designed to ensure fair and safe competition for all involved.<br>

<p>◘The Manual of Motorcycle Sport is an annual publication which contains both the GCRs as well as other relevant information on motorcycle sport.</p><br>

<p>◘Rule change request forms can be found here. Final date for submissions to be discussed by commissions for the 2019 MoMS is 16th of February 2018.</p><br>

<p>Note: Rules can be added, changed or deleted from one year to the next, before they appear in the next edition of the Manual of Motorcycle Sport, so please ensure you use this section of the website to stay up-to-date with the latest rules.</p></p>

       <p>Other than a time trial, a bike race is as much a battle of wits as it is a test of fitness. From team tactics to solo strategy, use this guide to claim that top podium spot.</p>

<p><b>Steps</b></p>

<p>1.When you're serious about competing, the race doesn't begin at the start line. Here, two pro racers share how they do their pre-race homework. </p>

<p>2.Your race-day shouldn't end once you cross the finish line. Here's how to create a knowledge base on the event, your competition and your own abilities.</p>
<p>3.	Big group finishes at the Tour de France seem chaotic, but there is strict order and discipline to setting up the train. What makes a proper leadout, and how can you and your teammates practice it?</p>
<p>4.Though breakaways may look like individual pusuits at victory, team tactics play a large part of their success or failure. Here are some ways to ensure your team has the advantage in your next race. </p>

<p>5. As part of the lead breakaway you're now closing in on the finish line. But how do you ensure that you've got the legs and the positioning to win the day?</p>

        <p>Whether you’re a biker or not we hope you find these 10 facts about motorcycling interesting enough to get your motor running:</p>


<p>Following are the some Facts of Motorcycke Racing.</p>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>

 <p>      

◘The front tyre provides 75 per cent of a bike’s grip when cornering.<br>
◘The Vespa brand of scooter got its name from the Italian word for wasp.<br>
◘As well as motorbikes, Kawasaki also makes spaceships. It only began making motorcycles in 1962 to publicise its ‘heavy industries’ which were unknown to the public.<br>
◘Devil, Satan and Lucifer have all been brands of motorcycles.<br>
◘The first motorcycle was the SH Roper 1869 steam cycle.<br>
◘His character The Fonz may have been the epitome of cool but actor Henry Winkler couldn't actually ride a motorcycle.<br>
◘When Valentino Rossi was five, his dad (a former motorbike racer himself) built him a go-kart as a substitute to biking out of concern for his son’s safety.<br>
◘The TOTO motorcycle built in Japan in 2010 ran on human waste.<br>
◘American Triumph dealer Bud Ekins did the now-famous 65ft motorcycle jump in The Great Escape (in one take), not Steve McQueen.<br>
◘Between 1917 and 1923 macho American bike firm Harley-Davidson made pushbikes. Meanwhile, Hell’s Angels founder Sonny Barger said in his autobiography he prefers Japanese bikes to Harleys.</p></p>
