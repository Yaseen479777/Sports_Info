        <p class = "txt"><P>Judo means "gentle way", is a modern Japanese martial art (gendai budō) and combat sport, that originated in Japan in the late nineteenth century. Its most prominent feature is its competitive element, where the object is to either throw one's opponent to the ground, immobilize or otherwise subdue one's opponent with a grappling.</P><P>

maneuver, or force an opponent to submit by joint locking the elbow or by executing a choke. Strikes and thrusts (by hands and feet)—as well as weapons defences—are a part of judo, but only in pre-arranged forms (kata) and are not allowed in judo competition or free practice (randori).
Ultimately, the philosophy and subsequent pedagogy developed for judo became the model for almost all modern Japanese martial arts that developed from "traditional" schools (koryū). In addition, the worldwide spread of judo has led to the development of a number of offshoots such as Sambo and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Practitioners of judo are called jūdōka</p><P>udo is loved by all generations and practised by people all over the world and of all ages from six to over eighty year, men and women of all walks of life. All have their own reasons for taking up Judo. Some want to be strong, some want to be healthy, to develop mental resolve, to experience the satisfaction of rigorous training, some want to be able to defend themselves, some want to become instructors of Judo, and some are already devoted to training others. Prof. Kano created Judo from Jujutsu as a philosophy of life and not only to learn techniques or ‘Waza’. He named the training institution "Kodokan". The word "Kodo" means to learn, prove and practice the principles.</p>

        <p>Martial arts or combat sports generally divide into three main types namely the punching and kicking ones such as boxing and Karate, the close quarter grappling ones such as wrestling and judo and the weapon ones such as fencing and Kendo. Judo was ‘invented’ in 1882 by a Japanese by the name of Jigoro Kano. However it was formed from a synthesis of Ju-jitsu styles, in particular the Kito and Tenjinshinyo styles. Jujitsu is the name for Japanese unarmed close-quarter fighting systems of which there were many in the late 1800s.</p><P>

The Japanese Samurai were trained to fight using a variety of weapons such as the sword and the spear but when it became close-quarter fighting the techniques of Ju-jitsu were used. For the most part the Ju-jitsu systems were grappling systems practised in pre-arranged sequences for safety. It could be said that Jigoro Kano created yet another Ju-jitsu style but his genius lay in recognizing that many of the Ju-jitsu techniques could be practised fairly safely. So in his system he created a competitive form of Ju-jitsu where the dangerous moves were banned (such as eye-poking) but retaining these dangerous techniques in the Kata or pre-arranged sequences of which there are seven. He called his system Judo to distinguish it from Ju-jitsu. Modern judo is mostly done in the competitive form (Randori) but the Kata are still taught and the individual can learn them if he wishes.</P><p>

In the competitive form the practitioner seeks to throw his opponent crisply on his back, gain a submission from an elbow lock or strangle, or pin the opponent on his back for 25 seconds. It is this competitive form that has become the Olympic sport of Judo. Despite the fact that Judo has excluded many of Ju-jitsu’s dangerous techniques it must be said that it is highly affective method of self-defence. Judo fighters become very skilful at throwing etc and the Randori makes them very fit and strong. Judo is done barefoot wearing a loose cotton jacket and trousers and a coloured belt which denotes the grade of the judo person (Judoka). It retains many of its Japanese features such as its Japanese terminology, strict etiquette and technical principles as laid down by the Founder.</p>

      <p>The traditional rules of judo are intended to avoid injuries to the participants and ensure proper etiquette. Some later additions to the rules were motivated by a desire to make the sport more interesting to observers.</p>

<p><b>Steps</b></p>


<P>Competition scoring
Judo has three grades of score: ippon, waza-ari and yuko. An ippon literally means "one point" and wins the match. Scoring is lexicographic; a waza-ari beats any number of yuko, but a waza-ari and a yuko beat a waza-ari with no yuko.<br>
◘When the koka was in use it was a lower score that yuko. A yuko beats any number of koka.
A fifteen-second hold down scores yuko. If the person who secured the hold down already has a waza-ari, they only need to hold the hold down for twenty seconds to score ippon by way of two waza-ari (waza-ari-awasete-ippon). Throws further lacking the requirements of an ippon or a waza-ari might score a yuko. If the scores are identical at the end of the match, the contest is resolved by the Golden Score rule. Golden Score is a sudden death situation where the clock is reset to match-time, and the first contestant to achieve any score wins.<br>

◘Representation of scores

Judo scoreboards show the number of waza-ari and yuko scores scored by each player. Some computerised scoreboards will briefly indicate that an ippon has been scored.
Scoreboards normally also show the number of penalties imposed on each player, and sometimes the number of medical visits for each. Electronic scoreboards also usually include timers for measuring both competition time and osekomi time.
"Koka" was the score of 1/8 point, until the new regulation changed.<br>

◘Penalties
First penalty given will be a warning which is noted on scoreboard. Second penalty will be scored as "yuko" for the opponent. Third penalty will be scored as "waza-ari". The fourth penalty is called "hansoku make".</p>

        <section class="y3" id="strategy">
        
        
        
       <p>
       <p>There are two divisions of rank: below-black-belt-level "grades" (kyū), and black-belt-level "degrees" (dan). There are ordinarily 10 dan ranks, which are ranked in ascending numerical order, though in principle there is no limit to the number of dan ranks.</p>
<P><p><b>Steps</b></p> <P>
1.Belt colours

For dan ranks, the first five are coloured black, 6th, 7th, and 8th dan have alternating red and white panels, and for 9th and 10th dan the belts are solid red.[30] However, holders of grades above godan (5th dan) will often wear a plain black belt in regular training.

Some countries also use colored tips on belts, to indicate junior age groups. Historically, women's belts had a white stripe along the centre.[citation needed]
The kyū ranks are normally awarded by local instructors (sensei), but dan ranks are usually awarded only after an exam supervised by independent judges from a national judo association.</P><P>

2.Brazil

Brazilian belt rankings are normally white, blue, yellow, orange, green, purple, brown and black. Additionally, a grey belt may be given to very young judoka (under 11 or 13 years old) just before the blue. Competitors are organised into two categories depending on grading; the first is from white to green, and the second is purple through black.

3.Canada

In Canada belt rankings for Seniors are, in ascending order: white, yellow, orange, green, blue, brown and finally black. Belt rankings for Juniors use white-red, white, white-yellow, yellow, yellow-orange, orange, red- green, green-blue, blue, blue-brown, and brown.</p>

<p>Following are the some facts of judo.</p>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>

       <p>◘Training with full power and speed against fully-resisting opponents: builds speed, stamina, strength, and tenacity.<br>

◘Body and mental conditioning by repeatedly being thrown with significant force.
Training in safe methods to take falls.<br>

◘Ability to accurately and quickly use balance, distance, and timing against skilled opponents in fully-resistive sparring. Judo practitioners are experts in controlling their opponent's balance whilst maintaining their own.
Sports Judo rules emphasize rapid transition to pins or submissions after a take-down, which builds skills in explosive use of chokes and locks in self-defense situations.<br>



◘Emphasis in controlling one's opponent during throws allow a practitioner to dictate the angle, direction, and force with which his or her opponent lands on the ground. The consequences could be gentle or lethal, depending on the Judo practitioner's intentions.<br>

◘However, there are some criticisms about the use of Judo for self-defense training:
Over-reliance on using the Judo-gi (clothing): In order to train Judo for self-defense, it is necessary to have some experience in sparring against partners who are not wearing a gi. Fortunately, the amount of adaptation needed is minor,[citation needed] and many techniques do not strictly rely on grabbing the gi; indeed, some techniques (especially in groundwork or Ne Waza) do not use the gi at all.<br>

◘Over-emphasis on the rules of sports Judo: Some Judo clubs or instructors teach Judo strictly in the context of sport.<br>
