<p>Cue sports (sometimes written cuesports), also known as billiard sports,[1][2] are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick, which is used to strike billiard balls and thereby cause them to move around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by elastic bumpers known as cushions.</p><P>

Historically, the umbrella term was billiards. While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For example, in British and Australian English, "billiards" usually refers exclusively to the game of English billiards, while in American and Canadian English it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon dialect and context. In other countries, the term "billiards" may be used colloquially to refer to pocket billiard-type games, such as pool, snooker, or Russian pyramid.</p><P>
Billiards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of Mary, Queen of Scots, in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of Shakespeare, including the famous line "let's to billiards" in Antony and Cleopatra (1606–07), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: Mozart, Louis XIV of France, Marie Antoinette, Immanuel Kant, Napoleon, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, George Washington, French president Jules Grévy, Charles Dickens, George Armstrong Custer, Theodore Roosevelt, Lewis Carroll, W.C. Fields, Babe Ruth, Bob Hope, and Jackie Gleason.</P>

        <p><p>Cue sports (sometimes spelled cuesports), also known as All cue sports are generally regarded to have evolved into indoor games from outdoor stick-and-ball lawn games (retroactively termed ground billiards), and as such to be related to trucco, croquet and golf, and more distantly to the stickless bocce and bowls.

English billiards (what UK speakers almost invariably mean by the word "billiards") is a hybrid carom/pocket game, and as such is likely fairly close to the ancestral original pocket billiards outgrowth from 18th to early 19th century carom games.</p><P>

There are few more cheerful sights, when the evenings are long, and the weather dull, than a handsome, well-lighted billiard room, with the smooth, green surface of the billiard table; the ivory balls flying noiselessly here and there, or clicking musically together. sports, are a wide variety of games of skill generally played with a cue stick which is used to strike billiard balls, moving them around a cloth-covered billiards table bounded by rubber cushions.

<p>
There are three major subdivisions of games within cue sports:
 <p><b>Steps</b></p>
<P>
◘Carom billiards, referring to games played on tables without pockets, including among others balkline and straight rail, cushion caroms, three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards.<br>
◘
Pocket billiards (or "pool") generally played on a table with six pockets, including among others eight-ball (the world's most widely played cue sport), nine-ball, straight pool, one-pocket and bank pool.<br>

◘More obscurely, there are games that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.</p></p>

        <p> <p><b>Steps</b></p>
        
        
        
      <p>
1.In the United States, the most commonly-played game is eight-ball. The goal of eight-ball, which is played with a full rack of fifteen balls and the cue ball, is to claim a suit (commonly stripes or solids in the US, and reds or yellows in the UK), pocket all of them, then legally pocket the 8 ball, while denying one's opponent opportunities to do the same with their suit, and without sinking the 8 ball early by accident. Pool halls in North America are increasingly settling upon the World Pool-Billiard Association International Standardised Rules.</p>

<p>


2.Nine-ball uses only the 1 through 9 balls and cue ball. The game is won by legally pocketing the nine ball. The World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), and it American affiliate the Billiard Congress of America (BCA), publish the World Standardized Rules. Male professionals have a rather fragmented schedule of professional nine-ball tournaments.

 

<P>


3.A variant using only three balls, generally played such that the player at turn continues shooting until all the balls are pocketed,

and the player to do so in the fewest shots wins. The game can be played by two or more players. Dispenses with some fouls common to both nine- and eight-ball.</P>

 


<P>

4.One-pocket is a strategic game for two players. The first player to pocket the majority of the balls (8) in his pocket wins the game. Most times, accomplished players choose to position balls near their pocket instead of trying to actually pocket them.</P>

 



<P>
5.Bank pool can be played with a full rack (can be a long game), but is more typically played with nine balls (frequently called "nine-ball bank"</p>

       <p>
       <p>It is important that you use your dominant eye for lining up and aiming the balls. Develop a technique for positioning your body in such a way that that your dominant eye and the intended shot are perfectly aligned. To achieve this alignment sometimes requires that you practically rest your chin on the cue. Some of the most brilliant pool players have mastered this billiards technique resulting in some spellbinding game play.</p><p><b>Steps</b></p>

<p>1.Making the Shot Weigh the pros and cons prior to taking every shot, then make a decision based on your analysis and aim the shot accurately. The best way to do this is to draw a straight imaginary line from the object ball and let this line touch the centre of the opening to the pocket. Next, extend this line in such a way that it passes through the object ball to the side opposite the pocket. The point of intersection between this imaginary line and the edge of the object ball is the perfect place to hit the ball. This ensures that the ball will go to the intended or desired direction.</p>

<p>

2.The next step in honing your pool technique is determining the exact point on the cue ball that will match up with the point identified on the object ball. At first glance, this may seem unattainable for the simple reason that you are absolutely standing behind the cue ball. However, this hurdle can be removed by visual means, which implies that you use your imagination to project where the object ball will be it comes in contact with the cue ball and ensure that both balls are aligned towards the pocket.</p>

<p>Following are the some facts of Soccer.</p>
<p><b>Steps</b></p>

       <p>World Championships

Regardless of all the restrictions, the first billiards championship was held in 1873. William Cook was crowned the winner and John Roberts was the runner up.<p> <p> <p><b>Steps</b></p>

<P>1.Fascination of Billiards

Even the historic celebrities were bitten by the billiards bug as both King Louis XI and Queen of Scots (whose own pool table cloth was used as her burial garment by her assassins) owned billiards table. Captain Mingaud, better known as the inventor of the leather cue tip, had a billiards table in his prison cell.</P>

<P>2.The French Connection

Billiards was derived from a French word for mace-“billiart” owing to the fact that before the widespread usage of the cue sticks (The word comes from “Queue” which means tail, in French) a wooden mace with a handle similar to a tail was used to shoot balls. A cue was considered as some weapon of mass destruction when given to women, as they were often accused of mishandling the cue and ripping the table cloth. Hence, only men were allowed to handle a cue.</P>

<P>3.First Female Champion of Billiards

This is may sound very strange, but the first woman to win a billiards championship was a man! The woman’s name was Frances Anderson and “she” was famous for outsmarting almost every pool player in both American and European pool circles during the first years of the 20th century. </P>
