        <p class = "txt"><P>Table tennis, also known as ping-pong, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight ball back and forth across a table using small rackets. The game takes place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players must allow a ball played toward them to bounce one time on their side of the table, and must return it so that it bounces on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play is fast and demands quick reactions. This high intense sport consists of Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, giving the hitter a great advantage.</P><P>

Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations. The table tennis official rules are specified in the ITTF handbook. Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988, with several event categories. From 1988 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event has been played instead of the doubles.</P><P>
In game play, the player serving the ball commences a play. The server first stands with the ball held on the open palm of the hand not carrying the paddle, called the freehand, and tosses the ball directly upward without spin, at least 16 cm (6.3 in) high. </P></p>

        <p>Like most other sports, table tennis had humble beginnings as a “parlor game,” open to anyone with access to a table, paddle, and ball. The game began in the 1880s, when lawn tennis players adapted their game to play indoors during the winter.

Ping-Pong is a trademark name for table tennis and associated equipment. The name “Ping-Pong” was invented by the English firm J. Jaques and Son at the end of the 1800s and later trademarked in the United States by Parker Brothers, the board game company.</p>

<P>The game quickly caught on, and as early as 1901, tournaments were being conducted with over 300 participants. The Ping-Pong Association was formed but was renamed The Table Tennis Association in 1922.

In 1902 a visiting Japanese university professor took the game back to Japan, where he introduced it to university students. Shortly after, a British salesman, Edward Shires, introduced it to the people of Vienna and Budapest, and the seeds were sown for a sport that now enjoys popularity all over the world. In Britain, table tennis had also begun to spread outside the distinctly middle-class confines of London, and leagues sprang up in provincial towns as far apart as Sunderland and Plymouth. In 1922, an All England Club was formed, which boasted such luminaries as Jack Hobbs the cricketer and other famous names of the time from the world of sport. The Daily Mirror organized and sponsored a nationwide tournament in which there were 40,000 competitors.</P><P>

Table tennis was firmly on the map, and on April 24, 1927, the English Table Tennis Association was born, under the chairmanship and direction of Ivor Montague, son of Lord Ewatthling. He was not only to become the architect of modern-day table tennis, but he also achieved critical acclaim as both a director and film producer. At the time, The ETTA had a membership of 19 leagues but now has over 300, with around 75,000 registered players.</p>

      <p>The ease and relative affordability of table tennis has made it one of the most popular sports in the world today in participation. Not only is the game easy to learn, but it is also extremely fun and requires little financial investment or space.

All you need is a table, a net, a ball and a racket to get started. You can play anywhere, at any anytime and just a couple of hours a week hitting that little white ball around can do wonders for your fitness.

Like all sports, there are of course some rules to follow, whether you’re playing a friendly match at the HDB void deck or participating in a tournament. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) is the sport’s main regulatory body and sets the rules for the game.</p>
      <p><b>Steps</b></p>
<p>◘	While there are fewer restrictions in a friendly match, the ITTF carefully regulates the equipment used during a tournament.<br>

◘The table, or playing surface, should be 2.74m long and 1.525m wide, on a platform 76cm above the floor. The top of the net, along its whole length, must also be 15.25cm above the playing surface.<br>

◘In a tournament, the ball used must have a diameter of 40mm and weigh exactly 2.7g. Additionally, the ball can only be made out of celluloid or similar plastics material and be either white or orange, and matt, in colour .<br>
◘Finally, the racket can be of any size, shape or weight but the blade must be flat and rigid and be made out of 85% natural wood. Before the start of a match, a player must allow his/her opponent and the umpire to inspect the racket he/she is about to use.</p>

<p><b>Steps</b></p>

<p>1.Mix up serves of different length and spin. Some examples of advanced serves include medium-long, deep, short, down-the-line, pure spin, pure speed, etc. Serves to the elbow tend to be very effective, since the receiver must quickly decide (and often does not in time) to use a forehand or backhand.<br>
2.Develop a third-ball attack. This is where you serve, the receiver receives, and you nail one in for a winner. An example is a short backspin serve, followed by a long push, then a powerful loop.
Attack whenever you can, primarily on a long serve. It has been proven that the player to open the offense most often usually wins point, set, and match.<br>
3.Keep your eyes mostly on the opponent's paddle when receiving a serve. If you have ever seen World Champion Jan-Ove Waldner play, you can see that he makes a quick glimpse at how high the ball is tossed, then watches back down to the racket. If you keep your eyes on the ball, the server will baffle you with his deceptions.<br>
4.Mix up your returns when receiving. Most players too often tend to push, allowing their opponents to start the offense. Mixing up loops, drives, pushes, chops, etc. provides for excellent variation and a bewildered opponent.<br>
5.Choose your equipment wisely. If you are ready for table tennis equipment, begin with a medium-fast blade (rather than fast). A medium-fast blade allows you to rely more on technique than on equipment to get the ball over the net. It will also provide optimum control. The most important consideration for a blade, however, is that it provides good "feeling." As for rubber try to get the "beginner" kinds for the beginning. The reason for this is because beginner rubbers are designed with less spin and speed, and this translates into easier returns of spinny balls. Trying to return a sidespin serve will be a hair-pulling experience for a beginner if he/she uses an overly spinny rubber.
